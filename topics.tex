\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Some topics for a final project}

In this chapter we collect some topics for a final presentation. 

\subsection*{Staircase groups}

This topic describes a situation similar to that of \S\ref{Kolchin}, but
more general. See \cite[Chapter 5]{MR1369573}.

\subsection*{Kegel--Wielandt theorem}

Prove Kegel--Wielandt theorem. The theorem states that if a finite group 
$G$ factorizes as $G=AB$ with $A$ and $B$ nilpotent subgroups, then $G$ 
is solvable. For the proof see 
\cite[Theorem 2.13]{MR1211633}. 

\subsection*{The Drinfeld double of a finite group}

See \cite[Chapter IX]{MR1321145} and 
\cite[Chapter 8]{MR3752618}.

\subsection*{Ito's theorem}

Ito's theorem generalize Frobenius' theorem
(Theorem \ref{thm:Frobenius_chi(1)})  
and Schur's theorem (Theorem \ref{thm:Schur_chi(1)}). 
The theorem states that if $\chi$ is an irreducible character
of a finite group $G$, then $\chi(1)$ divides 
$(G:A)$ for every normal abelian subgroup $A$ of $G$. 
See \cite[\S8.1]{MR0450380}. 

\subsection*{Characters of $\GL_2(q)$ and $\SL_2(q)$}

One possible topic is the character table of $\GL_2(q)$, see
\cite[\S5.2]{MR2867444}. Alternatively, one can 
present the character table of the group $\SL_2(p)$  
following Humphreys's paper \cite{MR364478}. 
The character theory of $\SL_2(q)$ appears in 
\cite[\S5.2]{MR2867444}, see 
\cite[Chapter 20]{MR1650707} for details. 

\subsection*{Representations of the symmetric group}

See for example \cite[\S10]{MR2867444} and 
\cite{MR1153249}. 

\subsection*{Random walks on finite groups}

The goal is to construct the character table or 
the irreducible representations of the symmetric group. 
The topic has connections with combinatorics and applications 
to voting and card shuffling. 
See \cite[4]{MR1153249} and \cite[\S11]{MR2867444}.

\subsection*{Fourier analysis on finite groups}

See \cite[\S5]{MR2867444} for a very elementary approach and some
basic applications. Other applications 
appear in \cite{MR1695775}.

\subsection*{McKay's conjecture}

Prove McKay's conjecture \ref{conjecture:McKay} for all sporadic simple groups. 
This was first proved by Wilson in \cite{MR1643110}. 
Note that
for some ``small" sporadic simple groups this can be done
with the script presented in \S\ref{McKay}. However, 
for several sporadic simple groups a different approach is needed. One needs
to know the structure of normalizers.

\subsection*{Ore's conjecture}

Prove Ore's conjecture \ref{conjecture:Ore} for alternating simple groups,
see for example \cite{MR40298}. It is also interesting to prove the conjecture
for other "small" simple groups such as $\PSL(3,2)$.  

\subsection*{An elementary proof of Brauer--Fowler theorem}

We need to find a subgroup of index $\leq 2n^2$. 
Let $X$ be the conjugacy class of $x$. For $g\in G$ let
\[
J(g)=\{z\in X:zgz^{-1}=g^{-1}\}.
\]
We claim that $|J(g)|\leq|C_G(g)|$. The map $J(g)\to C_G(g)$, $z\mapsto gz$, 
is well-defined,~as 
\[
(gz)g(gz)^{-1}=g(xgx^{-1})g^{-1}=g^{-1}\in C_G(g).
\]
It is injective, as $gz=gz_1$ implies $z=z_1$.

Let $\{(g,z)\in G\times X:zgz^{-1}=g^{-1}\}$.  
Since $X\times X\to J$, $(y,z)\mapsto (yz,z)$, 
is well-defined (since $z(yz)z^{-1}=zy=(yz)^{-1}$) and
it is trivially injective, 
\[
|X|^2\leq |J|=\sum_{(g,z)\in J}1\leq\sum_{g\in G}|J(g)|
=\sum_{g\in G}|C_G(g)|=k|G|,
\]
where $k$ is the number of conjugacy classes of $G$, 
as $(g,z)\in J$ if and only if $z\in J(g)$. Thus $|G|\leq kn^2$, as
\[
\left(\frac{|G|}{|C_G(x)|}\right)^2=|X|^2=\frac{|G|}{n^2}\leq k|G|.
\]

\begin{claim}
    There exists a conjugacy class with $\leq 2n^2$ elements.
\end{claim}

Assume that the claim is not true. Let
$C_1,\dots,C_k$ be the conjugacy classes of $G$, where 
$C_1=\{1\}$ and $|C_i|>2n^2$ for all $i\in\{2,\dots,k\}$. Then
\[
|G|=1+\sum_{i=2}^k|C_i|>1+\sum_{i=2}^kn^2=1+(k-1)2n^2\geq |G|,
\]
a contradiction. 

\begin{claim}
    There exists a subgroup $H$ of $G$ such that
    $(G:H)\leq 2n^2$.
\end{claim}

Let $C$ be a conjugacy class of $G$ such that 
$|C|\leq 2n^2$. Let $g\in C$.  
Then $H=C_G(g)$ is a subgroup of $G$ such that
$(G:H)\leq 2n^2$. 
This finishes the proof of the Brauer--Fowler theorem. 


\subsection*{Hirsh's theorem}

In \cite{MR36755} Hirsch found a generalization of Burnside's Theorem \ref{thm:Burnside_mod16}.  
If $G$ is a finite group and $d$ is the greatest common divisor of all 
the numbers $p^2-1$, where the $p$'s are prime divisors of $|G|$ and $r$ the number of conjugate sets in $G$. Then 
\[
|G|\equiv\begin{cases} 
    r\bmod 2d &\text{if $|G|$ odd,}\\
    r\bmod 3 & \text{if $|G|$ even and $\gcd(|G|,3)=1$.}
    \end{cases}
\]
The proof is elementary, does not use character theory. Is it possible
to prove Hirsch's theorem using characters?

\subsection*{Hurwitz's theorem}

\subsection*{Poincar\'e--Birkhoff--Witt theorem}

\subsection*{Weyl's theorem}

\subsection*{Irreducible representations of $U_q(\sl(2,\C))$}

Let $q\in\C\setminus\{0,1,-1\}$. 
Let $U_q(\sl(2))$ be the (complex) algebra generated by 
variables $E$, $F$, $K$ and $K^{-1}$ with relations
\begin{align*}
    &KK^{-1}=K^{-1}K=1,
    &&
    KEK^{-1}=q^2E,\\
    &
    KFK^{-1}=q^{-2}F,
    &&
    [E,F]=\frac{1}{(q-q^{-1})}(K-K^{-1}).
\end{align*}

Study the representation theory of $U_q(\sl(2))$. This splits into
two cases, depending on whether $q$ is a root of one or not. 
Finite-dimensional simple $U_q(\sl(2))$-modules are studied 
in \cite[VI]{MR1321145}. In particular, if 
$q$ is not a root of one, finite-dimensional simple $U_q(\sl(2))$-modules
are classified in \cite[Theorem VI.3.5]{MR1321145}. 

\subsection*{Semisimple modules of $U_q(\sl(2,\C))$}

Prove that if $q$ is not a root of one, any finite-dimensional
$U_q(\sl(2))$-module is semisimple. 
See \cite[Theorem VII.2.2]{MR1321145}.
