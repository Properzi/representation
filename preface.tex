The notes correspond to the master  
course \emph{Representation theory of algebras} of the 
Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 
Faculty of Sciences, 
Department of Mathematics and Data Sciences. The course
is divided into thirteen two-hour lectures. 

Most of the material is based on standard 
results of the representation theory of finite groups. 
Basic texts on representation theory are \cite{MR1369573} 
and \cite{MR2270898}.
