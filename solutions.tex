\begin{sol}{xca:deg2}
  Assume that $\phi$ is not irreducible. There exists a proper non-zero $G$-invariant 
  subspace $W$ of $V$. Thus $\dim W=1$. Let $w\in W\setminus\{0\}$.
  For each $g\in G$, $\phi_g(w)\in W$. Thus $\phi_g(w)=\lambda w$ for some 
  $\lambda$. This means that $w$ is a common eigenvector for all the $\phi_g$.
  Conversely, if $\phi$ admits a common eigenvector $v\in V$, then 
  the subspace generated by $v$ is $G$-invariant.
